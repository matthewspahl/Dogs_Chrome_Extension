# Dogs_Chrome_Extension
Google Chrome extension that counts how many times the word "dog" appears on the pages you visit. Modified from online tutorial, "How To Make Chrome Extensions" by Kyle Robinson Young.

The tutorial counts the word "bear," and I changed it to "dog" when I followed the tutorial.
